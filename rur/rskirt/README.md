This is a simple library for those who want to use SKIRT.
Here's a simple guidance for using this library:

    1. Please copy the SKIRT9 folder in /storage8/jangjk/.
        SKIRT frequently changes the hierarchy of the input/ski file.
        So this library/routine may need to be fixed for the latest version of the SKIRT. 
    
    2. Execute configureSKIRT.sh and makeSKIRT.sh. 
       If you want to use SKIRT with MPI, you can change the configuration with configureSKIRT.sh.
       
    3. Done. Now you can use this library.
